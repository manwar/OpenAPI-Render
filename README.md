OpenAPI-Render
==============

As of January 2020 there seem to be no lightweight tools to visualize OpenAPI v3 instances.
An alternative to this is to downgrade OpenAPI v3 to v2, for example, using [OpenAPI-3to2](https://github.com/merkys/OpenAPI-3to2) and then visualize with any of OpenAPI v2 tools.
